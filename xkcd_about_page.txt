<h3>&nbsp;Who are you?</h3><blockquote>
I'm just this guy, you know?  I'm a CNU graduate with a degree in physics. Before starting xkcd, I worked on robots at NASA's Langley Research Center in Virginia. As of June 2007 I live in Massachusetts. In my spare time I climb things, open strange doors, and go to goth clubs dressed as a frat guy so I can stand around and look terribly uncomfortable. At frat parties I do the same thing, but the other way around.</blockquote>

<h3>&nbsp;What else do you do?</h3><blockquote>
Occasionally produce a few extra comics such as a pair of comics for IBM's <a href="http://asmarterplanet.com/">A Smarter Planet initiative</a> (also archived <a href="http://xkcd.com/asmarterplanet/">here</a> as they are released).<br />
<br />
Encourage people to <a href="http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/Main_Page">get out and meet each other</a> in, hopefully, interesting places via <a href="http://xkcd.com/426/">geohashing</a>.<br />
<br />
Host a <a href="http://xkcd.com/chesscoaster/">gallery of photos</a> inspired by <a href="http://xkcd.com/249/">comic #249</a>.<br />
</blockquote>

<h3>&nbsp;Who else are you?</h3><blockquote>
Server maintenance and most of the coding for these sites is done by my friend davean, who tries hard to remain invisible but can be reached at <a href="mailto:davean@xkcd.com">davean@xkcd.com</a>. Designer <a href="http://www.cgleason.org/">Christina Gleason</a> also helps with posters, books, and various side projects.
</blockquote>

<h3>&nbsp;What does XKCD stand for?</h3><blockquote>
It's not actually an acronym. It's just a word with no phonetic pronunciation -- a treasured and carefully-guarded point in the space of four-character strings.
</blockquote>

<h3>&nbsp;Where did all this start?</h3><blockquote>
I was going through old math/sketching graph paper notebooks and didn't want to lose some of the work in them, so I started scanning pages. I took the more comic-y ones and put them up on a server I was testing out, and got a bunch of readers when BoingBoing linked to me. I started drawing more seriously, gained a lot more readers, started selling t-shirts on the site, and am currently shipping t-shirts and drawing this comic full-time. It's immensely fun and I really appreciate y'all's support.
</blockquote>

<h3>&nbsp;Why can't I read the whole comic mouseover text in Firefox?</h3><blockquote>
They can be read with extensions like <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1715/">Long Titles</a>, or by right-clicking on the images and going to 'properties', then clicking and dragging to read the whole thing.
This is a bug in Firefox, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45375">Mozilla Bug #45375</a>. It has been outstanding for many years now. 
<br /><br />
<b>Note:</b> It looks like it's been fixed in Firefox 3.0. Now, as an added tweak, to keep the tooltips from expiring while you're reading, you can use <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/11233">this</a>.
</blockquote>
<h3>&nbsp;Can we print xkcd in our magazine/newspaper/other publication?</h3><blockquote>
If it's a not-for-profit publication, you need no permission -- just print them with attribution to xkcd.com. You can post xkcd in your blog (whether ad-supported or not) with no need to get my permission.
</blockquote>

<h3>&nbsp;How can I find the date a comic was posted?</h3><blockquote>
The posting date is in the mouseover text on the archive page.
</blockquote>

<h3>&nbsp;Is there an interface for automated systems to access comics and metadata?</h3><blockquote>
Yes. You can get comics through the JSON interface, at URLs like <a href="http://xkcd.com/info.0.json">http://xkcd.com/info.0.json</a> (current comic) and <a href="http://xkcd.com/614/info.0.json">http://xkcd.com/614/info.0.json</a> (comic #614).
</blockquote>

<h3>&nbsp;How do I write "xkcd"?  There's nothing in Strunk and White about this.</h3><blockquote>
For those of us pedantic enough to want a rule, here it is:  The preferred form is "xkcd", all lower-case. In formal contexts where a lowercase word shouldn't start a sentence, "XKCD" is an okay alternative. "Xkcd" is frowned upon.

<h3>&nbsp;What is your favorite astronomical entity?</h3>
